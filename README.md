TIME LINE PROJECT 
Stage 2 focuses on building a responsive HTML and CSS layout featuring:

A modern header with a logo and a prominent call-to-action button.

A vertical timeline where event cards alternate sides with circular markers.

A hidden modal component, ready for future activation.

A clean, centered footer.

The design leverages Flexbox, media queries, and well-structured CSS to ensure seamless adaptability across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
